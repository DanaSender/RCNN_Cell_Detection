# Execute Labeling Tool:

* Open the folder placed where the tool has been saved and then to run a command line (terminal).

* Several inputs are then required as follows:
   
**counting_tool.exe** [-h] [-f FOLDER] [-i IMAGE] -s SAVE


**-i** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *[optional]* choose one image at a time followed by the path of the image.

**-f** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *[optional]* open a folder where a few images are located followed by the path of the folder.

**-s** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; followed by the path of the folder where the results have been saved

* Press Enter for the tool to execute.

* When the user finishes counting and all detected cells have been marked, the program is closed by pressing the
letter 'q' on the keyboard if the input selected was -i, and if the selected input was -f, the next image located in the
folder of images opens automatically.

* To exit the tool, the user can press 'e' on the keyboard anytime.
In both cases, the last results are saved. It is therefore better to first mark all cells in all channels and to only exit then.

Notes:
* It is better to first mark all cells in all channels and to only exit then.

* To run the tool it is needed to be python installed in the computer.
